Diabetic Retinopathy Risk Score Report

                Method used for Weighing Scores : STRING INTERATIONS BETWEEN SELECT GENES

                The scores are first weighted by the degrees of freedom of each gene.
                Then according to the data available on interactions,  a certain multiplier is used for pairs of genes occuring together in a patient as follows :
                {'ACE_DPP4': 2, 'ACE_APOE': 4, 'ACE_VEGFA': 4, 'ACE_ADM': 2, 'ADIPOQ_CNR1': 2, 'AKR1B1_ALDH2': 16, 'CDKAL1_FTO': 2}
